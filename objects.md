# Object

You can also add objects to the map. These are a series of graphical elements you can use to indicate things such as traps on the map.

Objects can be added using the sequence <coord>$<specifier>. eg. `a1$T` to indicate a trap should be placed in `a1`

## Size and Rotation

Objects can be made to cover multiple gridcells

```

They can even be rotated
