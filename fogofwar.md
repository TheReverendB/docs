# Fog of war

Fog of war allows you to only reveal certain parts of the map or more map over time. Using `*f ` will activate fog of war on your map. From there you designate the top left square and the bottom right of the area you want to reveal as in`*fb2d2`. example seen below. 

**Note** - Fog of war will only be active if there is a background image loaded and `*f` is present within the map URL. 

_**Example**_
