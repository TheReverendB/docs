# Avrae aliases and OTFBM

Discord users `@Croebh#5603` and `@Nerds and Dragons#2817` have embraced OTFBM and created some really awesome Avrae aliases that utilize the site.

## Avrae

Avrae is a Discord bot centered around D&D 5e.  It also has a built in automation and scripting engine.  For more information on the bot please visit their website: https://avrae.io

## Map, Move, and Over aliases

To get the code for the aliases please join the OTFBM discord at: https://discord.gg/PVCtMqN

Run the following commands in the `#command-spam` channel on the OTFBM discord:


Map uses the web based OTFBM to create a map inside avrae embeds.
```
!servalias map
```
Move allows users to move their own characters on the map by providing coordinates.  Even showing their movement on the map in a overlay.
```
!servalias move
```
Both of these Aliases have extensive help documentation available via discord.
